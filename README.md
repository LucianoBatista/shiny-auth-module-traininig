# Shiny Auth Module Training

This repo have just an update of the session about authentication and module training from [Shiny Developer Course](https://university.business-science.io/p/expert-shiny-developer-with-aws-course-ds4b-202a-r). This one use `moduleServer` instead of the `callModule` old approach.

I also updated the code where we use the {shinyauthr} package.
